Description: Graphical interface to manage configurations for the IntelMQ framework.
 A IntelMQ configuration is a set of config files which describe which
 bots and processing steps should be run in which order. It is similar
 to describing the dataflow in dataflow oriented languages. IntelMQ
 Manager is therefore an intuitive tool to allow non-programmers to
 specify the data flow in IntelMQ.
